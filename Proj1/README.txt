you gotta change the hostname in DNSRS to your own hostname (i used ilab3.cs.rutgers.edu)
you run this by doing:
example -> python rs.py 1234
            python ts.py 1324
            python client.py yourHostName 1234 1324 (rs.py port # ts.py port #)
answers will show up in RESOLVED.txt

and we still gotta answer the Qs he asked us to answer in the instructions, bt the code seems to work for the test cases i used
